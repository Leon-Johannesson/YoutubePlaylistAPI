## YoutubePlaylistAPI
Making a app that can download youtube playlist and play them in the background without high ram usage (f webbrowsers)

## INSTALLATIONS

# Libraries underneath have to be pip installed
* A ffmpeg.exe file to convert .mp3 to .wav
* playsound Library
* pytube Library

## Usage 

  This program is used to download a youtube <br>playlist as to dismiss the need of having <br>a browser on in the background sucking of your ram. <br>Normal browsers use at least 700+ mb ram <br>while this program uses about 10-20mb ram.

## Contributing

  Don't, any questions with the program or valid changes <br>should be sent to me via discord ;) Radioactive#0640

## To-do

* Let the user change the volume   
* Let the user have multiple playlists

## Issues

* The library "Pylib" is not currently working
